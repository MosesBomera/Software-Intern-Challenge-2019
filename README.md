# Software-Intern-Challenge-2019
A lightweight system to; Accrue points for each employee each month; Track an employee’s “points balance” according to the number of points accrued, and the number of points used; Allow an employee to privately query their own points balance (allow for access controlled balance requests); Allow for access controlled withdrawal requests with manager sign off; Trigger balance deduction and expense request creation sent to finance.

All the code logic is included in the accrual_storage.ipynb file, in three classes, Db for handling the database, Employee for handling employee functions and Accrual, for tracking and performing points accrual.
